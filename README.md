# airplaneSimulator
Physics based airplane simulator coded in Java.
Created in 2014, uses the hsa.Console in Java and graphics integrated into that library.
Perspective is used to make everything look much more realistic and shows distance in 3D objects much better.
Moving objects in the environment uses complex physics equations using angles, alpha, beta.
Velocity is also used for the airplane.
